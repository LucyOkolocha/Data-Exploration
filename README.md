# Data-Exploration
In this project, I used SQL Server to explore the Covid-19 dataset which I downloaded from "Our World in Data".
The data exploration process are:
Total Cases vs Total Deaths
Total Cases vs Population - to shows what percentage of population got covid
Compared countries with highest infection rate to population
Countries with Highest Death Count per Population
Showing continents with the highest death count per population
Join both tables
Total Population vs Vaccinations
Partition 
Use CTE
Creat TEMP Table
Create Views to store data for visualizations
